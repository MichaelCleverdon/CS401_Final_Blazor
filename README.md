# Instructions for running the app

## Heroku app
Navigate to https://cs401-finalapp.herokuapp.com/browse. The app is located there

## Local server
1. Clone the repo
2. Install the dotnet 5 runtime https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/5.0 (you might need the sdk, but I would start with just the runtime since it's smaller)
3. Open the cloned repo and type `dotnet build` (this will build all the artifacts that you will need)
4. type `dotnet run` and a console will open up saying where the server is hosted at
5. Navigate to the server (mine was hosted at localhost:5000) and you can start looking through the app
